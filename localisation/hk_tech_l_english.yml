 HKG_gw_armored_car_equipment_desc:0 "Where previous armored cars were simple commercial models with thin steel plating, this model was designed from the ground up to carry armor and light armament. In order to catch and arrest criminals in the act, 6 BMW Unimog U5000 have been bought by the Hong Kong Police Force. HKPF uses these armored cars to crush the protestors, this is totally War Crime! Luckily, one of them has a total loss in the battle of PolyU in Nov 2019. It seems that Molotov is the best weapon to damage the car. God bless Hong Kong! "
